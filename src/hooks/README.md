## This folder will contain all the custom hooks.

## Use this readme file to document all the hooks and their use.

## Rules:

1. File names should use `PascalCase` as the name conventions.
2. Variable names should use `camelCase` as the name conventions.
3. For the colors use variable names defined in `tailwind.config.js`. Tailwind Example: ` bg-primary text-onPrimary`
